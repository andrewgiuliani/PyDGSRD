# üõ´&nbsp; PyDGSRD 
This is a Python code that solves 1D hyperbolic conservation laws on nonuniform grids using the state redistribution method.  State redistribution is an algorithm that solves the small cell problem on cut cell grids.  That is, arbitrarily small cells on embedded boundary grids result in overly restrictive maximum stable time steps when using explicit time stepping algorithms. Similar in spirit to flux redistribution by Collela [1], state redistribution relaxes this time step restriction using a simple postprocessing operation.  Of course, this algorithm is most interesting in two and three dimensions, but this one-dimensional code illustrates the important aspects of the algorithm.

## üèó&nbsp; Grid generation and preprocessing 
Nonuniform grids on which state redistribution can be applied are generated using `gengrid.py`.  For example, the call

```
python gengrid.py -L -1.0 -R 1.0 -N 100 -MESHTYPE uniform -MERGETYPE LRP
```
randomly generates a nonuniform grid on the interval [-1.0,1.0] with 100 elements.  The cell sizes are generated using a uniform distribution, and merging neighborhoods are generated by merging to the left and right periodically.  The different arguments that `gengrid.py` accepts are explained below:


-N 
number of cells on the grid

-L
left endpoint

-R
right endpoint

-MESHTYPE
* `uniform`: uniform grid.
* `rand`: cell sizes follow a uniform distribution.
* `perturb`: cells are generated by perturbing the endpoints of a uniform grid.
* `power`: cell sizes follow a power law distribution.
* `paper`: this is the grid used to demonstrate one-dimensional SRD in our paper.
* `bdry1`: one small cell on the left boundary, otherwise uniform.
* `brdy2`: one small cell on the left and right boundary, otherwise uniform.

-MERGETYPE

* `LRNP`: merge to the left, right, non-periodically.
* `LRP`:  merge to the left, right, periodically.
* `LP`: merge only to the left, periodically.
* `RP`: merge only to the right, periodically.

All of the above options create neighbourhoods using a specified tolerance (TOL) in the code, whereby cells are merged to the left or to the right until the neighborhood satisfies a size constraint:

After the grid generator finishes, it output three files.  
- The file with extension `.dat`, contains the `N+1` grid endpoints.  
- The file with extension `.pdat` contains the preprocessing information that specifies the merging neighborhoods.  The file contains three columns corresponding to `m`, `M`, and `overlaps` in the code.  `m` and `M` specify the indices of the first and last cell in the merging neighbourhoods.  For example the merging neighborhood associated to cell 5 is made up of cells with indices `m[5], m[5]+1, ..., M[5]`.  `overlaps` contains the number of neighborhoods that overlap each cell in the grid.
- The file with extension `.mdat` contains metadata about the preprocessing stage: cell size to be used in the CFL condition, which merging algorithm was chosen, the merging tolerance, and type of random grid that was generated.

## üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è&nbsp; Running the code 
`PyDGSRD` can be called after grid generation with, for example,
```
python PyDGSRD.py -P 5 -T 1 -G grid_100
```
which computes a sixth order (`p = 5`) approximation to the solution at the final time (`T = 1`) on `grid_100`.
The different arguments that `PyDGSRD.py` accepts are explained below:

-P
polynomial degree of approximation

-T
final time

-G
grid filename (without any file extensions!)

-PLOT
plot the numerical solution at the final time using matplotlib
