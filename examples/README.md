This folder contains three examples to learn how to use the code:
- 1_gengrid shows how to generate nonuniform grids in 1D on which the stabilized DG method can be used.
- 2_run shows how to run the DG code from a driver file, where inputs to the DG code are provided in the driver code.
- 3_argrun shows how to run the DG code, where inputs to the DG code are provided at command line.
